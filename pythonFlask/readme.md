# About
This is an example of a basic python flask server. This application is a simple adding application, but the concepts used in this code can be used to created lots of other applications.

# Getting Started
## Getting your environment setup
1. install python3
```
brew install python3
```

2. install flask
```
$ sudo -H python3 -m pip install flask
```

3. I am using VS Code so I installed the python extension

4. In my experience if the python environment isn't set up right, it can cause some strange problems...for me the sysmptom was that the jinja templates were not rendering properly.
